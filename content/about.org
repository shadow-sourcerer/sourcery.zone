#+TITLE: About

[[/][Sourcery Zone]] is a personal project of mine to craft a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alter_ego][new ego]] around
my interests without being limited by my [[https://paulgraham.com/identity.html][real life identity.]]

In here, I'll write about my learning process, and outcome of the
projects I build around them. The main subjects consist of:

1. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence][Artificial Intelligence]]
2. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotics][Robotics]]
3. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business][Business]] and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entrepreneurship][Entrepreneurship]]
4. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security][Cybersecurity]]

**Note:** I'll complete the content of this page gradually, like any
  other pieces of this blog.
