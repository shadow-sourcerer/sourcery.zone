[Sourcery Zone](/) is a personal project of mine to craft a [new ego](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alter_ego) around
my interests without being limited by my [real life identity.](https://paulgraham.com/identity.html)

In here, I'll write about my learning process, and outcome of the
projects I build around them. The main subjects consist of:

1.  [Artificial Intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence)
2.  [Robotics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotics)
3.  [Business](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business) and [Entrepreneurship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entrepreneurship)
4.  [Cybersecurity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security)

****Note:**** I'll complete the content of this page gradually, like any
  other pieces of this blog.
